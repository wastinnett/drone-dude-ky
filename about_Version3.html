        <h2>About Drone Dude KY</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Adam, the dude behind Drone Dude KY! I’m based in Central Kentucky and what started as a simple hobby with a drone has turned into a passion for helping people capture their property from the air. As a licensed drone operator and a background in marketing and digital design, I enjoy creating high-quality aerial photos and videos to showcase your property, business, or special memory.
